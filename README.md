# Automated Writing Feedback
MSc Thesis TU Delft

RevisionCoach is an automated writing feedback model to provide 4 layers of feedback to student essays:
1. Sentence-level highlight to indicate sentences contain a mistake
2. Writing assessment category (coherence, cohesion, readability, formality)
3. Correction category (reword, rephrase, rewrite)
4. Suggested sentence-level improvement (a correction)

All code is developed using google colab notebooks (premium). RevisionCoach's code is accessible [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/13y41vujR-PaTtkHoN2b2Qf2VOap0vhhi?usp=sharing)
